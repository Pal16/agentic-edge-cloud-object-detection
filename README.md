# agentic-edge-cloud-object-detection
Built a reproducible, agentic edge–cloud object detection system with dynamic inference routing, achieving statistically significant COCO mAP improvements while maintaining real-time performance.

## Overview
This project presents a scalable, agentic object detection system that dynamically
routes inference between edge and cloud models to balance accuracy, latency, and cost.

## Key Contributions
- Edge-first real-time inference using YOLOv8
- Transformer-based cloud refinement (RT-DETR)
- Agent-based dynamic routing
- Formal COCO evaluation (AP, AP-S/M/L)
- Statistical significance testing

## Architecture
## Results
- Scale-wise COCO mAP improvements
- Statistically significant gains over baselines
- Real-time FPS maintained

## Reproducibility
All experiments are runnable via Google Colab notebooks.
Deformable DETR results are reported from official MMDetection benchmarks.
